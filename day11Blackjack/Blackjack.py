############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size.
## There are no jokers.
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game:
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here:
#   https://appbrewery.github.io/python-day11-demo/

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements:
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created:
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.



def deal_card():
    """
    Return a random card from the deck.
    :return : card
    """
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    card = random.choice(cards)
    return card


# Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
def play_game():
    print(logo)
    user_cards = []
    computer_cards = []
    for _ in range(2):
        user_cards.append(deal_card())
        computer_cards.append(deal_card())


    # Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input
    # and returns the score.
    # Look up the sum() function to help you do this.
    def calculate_score(list_of_cards):

        # Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
        if sum(list_of_cards) == 21 and len(cards) == 2:
            return 0

        # Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
